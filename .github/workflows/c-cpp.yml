          # Why? Line Endings.
          # actions/checkout runs as a native windows environment and wants
          # to put CRLF on all lines, while msys2 looks at this and thinks
          # that every single file has been changed since the line ending is
          # not LF. Afterwards, `meson dist` (on msys2) will report the repo as
          # dirty then fail on meson >=0.62 due to the changed default behavior
          # dist fails on dirty repos. The solution to this is to just add
          # `--allow-dirty` since our CI runners use the latest meson. But this
          # is not the cleanest solution since we do care if the repo is dirty,
          # so add a non-whitespace diff-index check before running meson-dist.
