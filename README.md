# DEPENDENCIES

### Runtime/Build Required Dependencies

transmission-remote-gtk:

 - gtk >= 3.22
 - glib >= 2.56 (including gio and gthread)
 - json-glib >= 1.2.8

### Optional Dependencies

 - libappindicator or libayatana-appindicator3, Application tray support

If these libraries are installed at build time they will be automatically

### Build Only Dependencies
transmission-remote-gtk uses meson for its build system. A relatively new
version of meson is required.

 - meson >= 0.59.0
 - appstream-util (optional, appdata validation)
 - desktop-file-utils (optional, desktop file validation)

An example of getting the build dependencies for an Ubuntu/Debian system:

```
# apt install gcc meson appstream-util perl
```

**NOTE:** Ubuntu and other stable or LTS distros may have outdated versions of
meson that will not work for compiling transmission-remote-gtk. Meson can also
be installed via pip:

```
# apt-get install python3-pip
$ pip install meson
```
